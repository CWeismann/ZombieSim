Use A* algorithm, which is built-in to arcade

Zombies pathfind to human
Humans pathfind to spot in field of view that is within play area
    Use heuristic that picks best spot- farthest from zombs?

Decision trees- "balance the tree, but make commonly used branches shorter than rarely used ones
and put the most expensive decisions late"

OPTIONS
    Rule-based system: what we have already
        Pretty simple
        A bit bloated
    Behavior trees/state machine: RELAXED/MOTIVATED/ALERT
        Not very complicated
        Obviously deterministic
    Goal-oriented: goals with various weights (stay alive/kill/get item/etc.)
        More complicated
        More "realistic" behavior
    Blackboards
        Can be used with other options
        Allows coordination between agents
