Use A* algorithm, which is built-in to arcade

Zombies pathfind to human
Humans pathfind to spot in field of view that is within play area
    Use heuristic that picks best spot- farthest from zombs?

Decision trees- "balance the tree, but make commonly used branches shorter than rarely used ones
and put the most expensive decisions late"

OPTIONS
    Rule-based system: what we have already
        Pretty simple
        A bit bloated
    Behavior trees/state machine: RELAXED/MOTIVATED/ALERT
        Not very complicated
        Obviously deterministic
    Goal-oriented: goals with various weights (stay alive/kill/get item/etc.)
        More complicated
        More "realistic" behavior
    Fuzzy Logic:
        Possibly quite complicated
        Value of current location vs. other location
    Machine Learning:
        Very complicated
        Might not be feasible
    Blackboards:
        Can be used with other options
        Allows coordination between agents

Strategy/Tactics
    Cover points/tactical locations
        Preset graph far preferred- low/no randomization
    Agent influence- closer = stronger
        Location influence/security
    Frag Maps
        Preset graph required
    Tactical Pathfinding
        Might be tough to implement with built-in A*
    Emergent Cooperation
        Easy, but might be predictable and hard to improve
    Cooperation Scripts
        Too predictable- poor idea for this application

Machine Learning
    Decision learning
        Very good choice
        Works with decision trees
